# id() function is used to find the memory address of the variable according to value

a = 20
print(id(a))

b = 20
print(id(b))

c = 30
print(id(c))

''' the memory address of variable a & b are same because the value of a & b are same 
but the memory address of variable c is different because the value of c is different '''
